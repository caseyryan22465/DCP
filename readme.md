# DCP

DCP, or Daily Coding Problems, is a collection of various mini-projects not large enough to have their own repo but advanced enough where I want to save it somewhere


## List of problems and descriptions
- postfixCalc
   - Calculates postfix notation style math. Mainly an excuse to use generics, linkedlists, and stacks after learning about them in class.
